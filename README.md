# YUEJIA

1. Instead of seperating content, seperate by work part first. then features. 
- I think my code literacy has improved alot. backend was done by javier, and i can understand the code even though i never use mongoose, passport or axios

2. We were total lost at the start at how to split the work. As in no prior experience in group work. 
- its good to straighten out the workflow and make sure the workflow works for the project. Like trello, creating repo and how we gonna deploy. we just follow on the workflow we set out to do. 

1. Speed and data algorithms are my weakness. In building React, as it gets more complicated, I find it hard to manage especially the state. There are many ways to solve a problem. Do not know how to compare which is better solution. Eg. comment features. How to decide when a component need state, when it needs props. 

2. Have not learn how to use the entire React component lifecycle. (https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

componentDidMount()
componentWillUnmount()
componentDidUpdate()

REACT Hook (danny group) to store user data. 

























## PACKAGE TO INSTALL BEFORE USAGE

1) npm install react-router-dom
2) npm install mdbreact
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
